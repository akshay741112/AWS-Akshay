1-What is cloud Computing?
=Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

2-Cloud Computing Diployment Models?
Private Cloud=
In an on-premises, or private cloud computing deployment model an enterprise deploys their own infrastructure and applications into their own data center. The data center can be on-premises or co-location (col0). Though an on-premises deployment is very much the “legacy IT” setup, it can have many of the characteristics of cloud computing if the stack is designed properly – hence turning it into a “private cloud”.
Public Cloud=
When we talk about “cloud computing” this is typically what’s being discussed and is the model which provides most of the advantages of cloud computing. A Public cloud computing deployment model means the IT services that you consume are hosted and delivered from a third party and accessed over the Internet. Services are available to the “public” to use, so any organization or end user can create an account with their credit card.
Hybrid Cloud=
What is hybrid cloud? This is a cloud computing deployment model in which a combination of on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud services are consumed. This model is extremely common, especially with larger organizations, as a single cloud deployment model may not be optimal for all workloads.
Multicloud=
The term “multicloud” has come into the IT architect’s vocabulary fairly recently. Multicloud refers to the usage of two or more public clouds at a time, and possibly multiple private clouds. This is not to be confused with hybrid cloud, where you use different deployment models such as private and public.

3-Service models in cloud?
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is a computing infrastructure managed over the internet. The main advantage of using IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the cost and complexity of purchasing and managing the physical servers.
*Characteristics of IaaS=
There are the following characteristics of IaaS -
Resources are available as a service
Services are highly scalable
Dynamic and flexible
GUI and API-based access
Automated administrative tasks
Example: DigitalOcean, Linode, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Rackspace, and Cisco Metacloud.



Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS cloud computing platform is created for the programmer to develop, test, run, and manage the applications.
Characteristics of PaaS
There are the following characteristics of PaaS -
Accessible to various users via the same development application.
Integrates with web services and databases.
Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as per the organization's need.
Support multiple languages and frameworks.
Provides an ability to "Auto-scale".
Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud, and OpenShift.



Software as a Service (SaaS)=
SaaS is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these applications with the help of internet connection and web browser.
Characteristics of SaaS=
There are the following characteristics of SaaS -Managed from a central location
Hosted on a remote server
Accessible over the internet
Users are not responsible for hardware and software updates. Updates are applied automatically.
The services are purchased on the pay-as-per-use basis
Example: BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, ZenDesk, Cisco WebEx, ZenDesk, Slack, and GoToMeeting.
